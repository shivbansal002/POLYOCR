train_1311.jpg,There are three kinds of reasons that justify
train_1312.jpg,to the policy of the United States .
train_1313.jpg,the Polaris base has generated some antagonism

train_1326.jpg,Britain alone .
train_1327.jpg,there is a distinct possibility that so long
train_1328.jpg,Soviet Union might retaliate against

train_4244.jpg,I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British

train_4900.jpg,largely based on this . It was on a
train_4901.jpg,afternoon service at the church , each child

train_4903.jpg,being given a number which , as they came into
train_4904.jpg,naughty child with the penalty of not being
train_4905.jpg,the children enjoyed the service , and I heard
train_4906.jpg,are parents or even grandparents
train_4907.jpg,they were a most delightful lot , and
train_4908.jpg,it is a great joy to meet them now
train_4909.jpg,on Sunday afternoon . I hope the threat
train_4910.jpg,kept them good in the week , but anyway
train_4911.jpg,allowed to come to the Children's Church
train_4912.jpg,It was quite amusing to see how much
train_4913.jpg,of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
train_4914.jpg,fifty years afterwards when so many
train_4915.jpg,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
train_4916.jpg,sons was just coming into the world in this year
train_4917.jpg,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
train_4918.jpg,and his family , the youngest of whose three
train_4919.jpg,to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was
train_4920.jpg,Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
train_4921.jpg,with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton
train_4922.jpg,of 1913 .
train_4923.jpg,continuing till old age to-day . When I went
train_4924.jpg,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
train_4925.jpg,all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry . Mr. and
train_4926.jpg,Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
train_4927.jpg,some tempers were easily frayed , the most
train_4928.jpg,deep friendship which I have taken with me through
train_4929.jpg,loyal and devoted friends .

train_4931.jpg,lived on in Purley - have always been

train_4933.jpg,another we do not forget .
train_4934.jpg,outset , and when we don't see one
train_4935.jpg,failed . Their three boys , now successful men ,
train_4936.jpg,Their homes - for since those years they have
train_4937.jpg,havens of rest , and the welcome has never
train_4938.jpg,frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with
train_4939.jpg,at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners .
train_4940.jpg,In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full
train_4941.jpg,both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
train_4942.jpg,The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in
train_4943.jpg,Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards
train_4944.jpg,the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
train_4945.jpg,I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them
train_4946.jpg,someone who knew their native villages .
train_4947.jpg,scorned these more simple country folk .
train_4948.jpg,I could at once notice the great antagonism
train_4949.jpg,between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly

train_4951.jpg,lead to disaster . Then there had been much talk of

train_4954.jpg,outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
train_4955.jpg,one to fear that the event might well have the
train_4956.jpg,the setting up among the German population of a
train_4957.jpg,thousand of Nazi rule , so far from creating
train_4958.jpg,universally a dull bewildered apathy .
train_4959.jpg,meeting of East and West was marked by
train_4960.jpg,more than a fantasy . Thanks to the good
train_4961.jpg,sense of the front line soldiers , the
train_4962.jpg,vodka . And the effect on the German people
train_4963.jpg,of the first ten years of the promised
train_4964.jpg,the use of no weapon more lethal than
train_4965.jpg,a spirit of warlike frenzy , had produced
train_4966.jpg,The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
train_4967.jpg," Werewolves " that we had contemplated the necessity of very
train_4968.jpg,special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen . Particular
train_4969.jpg,and death over Germany , causing such wholesale slaughter among
train_4970.jpg,So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
train_4971.jpg,men , women and children , old and young alike .
