validation_117.jpg,And we want all to eat and drink His Great Philosophy of the
validation_118.jpg,questions is seeking the opinion of the one who is
validation_119.jpg,four ways of Israel's redemption . Hence " four questions " , which are
validation_120.jpg,to help them to face whatever it is that
validation_121.jpg,of use telling even children , as I have
validation_122.jpg,irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
validation_123.jpg,fears are based upon completely
validation_124.jpg,to pull themselves together . Far better
validation_125.jpg,cause and then deal with it ; show it
validation_126.jpg,In the first place it is not a great deal
validation_127.jpg,already suggested , not to be silly or
validation_128.jpg,is worrying them , to find the original
validation_129.jpg,up either for the sham it is - and many
validation_130.jpg,on .
validation_131.jpg,There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
validation_132.jpg,too many details , would help many a child to make a
validation_133.jpg,proper adjustment to life as it grows up . Let us look
validation_134.jpg,A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into
validation_135.jpg,at Jesus . We do not , I think , see there a life without fear .
validation_136.jpg,Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
validation_137.jpg,partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
validation_138.jpg,purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only
validation_139.jpg,amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be
validation_140.jpg,from innocence .
validation_141.jpg,effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes
validation_142.jpg,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired
validation_143.jpg,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A
validation_144.jpg,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
validation_145.jpg,of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night ,
validation_146.jpg,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
validation_147.jpg,attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do
validation_148.jpg,even if they do sleep .
validation_149.jpg,we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
validation_150.jpg,staggered . Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to
validation_151.jpg,through .
validation_152.jpg,If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
validation_153.jpg,become too pernickety . Nevertheless , we could all probably
validation_154.jpg,be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
validation_155.jpg,worse the school system whereby for
validation_156.jpg,a critic may say - you are calling
validation_157.jpg,they say , to get into a rut . Save us
validation_158.jpg,us to adventure , do not strangle us before
validation_159.jpg,exactly what , on any given day of the
validation_160.jpg,we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
validation_161.jpg,routine destroys the soul . It is so easy ,
validation_162.jpg,from the school curriculum and even
validation_163.jpg,There may be some who will argue that
validation_164.jpg,week , they are going to have . If - such
validation_165.jpg,meals everybody knows beforehand
validation_166.jpg,that he was a great man for lace - paying
validation_167.jpg,didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
validation_168.jpg,and I fell out about my not being willing
validation_169.jpg,as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this
validation_170.jpg,We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
validation_171.jpg,to have her gown laced . '
validation_172.jpg,for his lady , for he records testily : ' My wife
validation_173.jpg,reign of Charles 2 stating : ' Lost : a lawn 1hand-
validation_174.jpg,fine Point lace about four fingers broad ' and
validation_175.jpg,among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
validation_176.jpg,unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with
validation_177.jpg,kercher with a broad hem laced round with
validation_178.jpg,silver lace ' . The records of these tender trifles
validation_179.jpg,are very touching but then lace does place
validation_180.jpg,upon everything a delicate sentiment .

validation_819.jpg,with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
validation_820.jpg,and hold up the stage , it 'll be a couple or
validation_821.jpg,goes for me , gentlemen , " I said . " If they do try
validation_822.jpg,on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
validation_823.jpg,I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
validation_824.jpg,Gay , sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could
validation_825.jpg,to do that . " Gavin drained his glass
validation_826.jpg,hardly believe that she was the same girl ,
validation_827.jpg,and refilled it .
validation_828.jpg,Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
validation_829.jpg,table for the first time a few days ago .
validation_830.jpg,and Gay's heart turned over . " I 'd like
validation_831.jpg,miserable , shy , who had sat at the little
validation_832.jpg,who is tough enough to change him . "
validation_833.jpg,you know , always , and you aren't the type
validation_834.jpg,trust him out of your sight and having to put on
validation_835.jpg,whenever he flirts with another woman . He will
validation_836.jpg,a brave face and pretend that you don't mind
validation_837.jpg,Hell . " Doc answered for her . " Just Hell . Never able to
validation_838.jpg,be the same , if you know what I mean . " " You sound
validation_839.jpg,like Alice in Wonderland , " Doc gently mocked her , " and
validation_840.jpg,I 'm glad you 're beginning to see that you 're wasting
validation_841.jpg,now that I do realise that , and in any case , " she added
validation_842.jpg,a little sadly , " if I did change Gavin , he wouldn't
validation_843.jpg,your time on that chap .
validation_844.jpg,Gay nodded . " I know that you 're right Doc , I think
validation_845.jpg,I 'd marry you myself . " Gay laughed , Doc was
validation_846.jpg,as it obviously appeared to everyone else .
validation_847.jpg,long for the right man for you to come
validation_848.jpg,so kind and nice and she hoped that one
validation_849.jpg,Now let him go and you won't have to wait
validation_850.jpg,day she would be able to see the situation
validation_851.jpg,along . If I was thirty years younger and weren't
validation_852.jpg,married to the sweetest wife in the world
validation_853.jpg," I made it myself , " Gay tried to speak
validation_854.jpg,normally .
validation_855.jpg,the roundabout , which was
validation_856.jpg,least . She would think of her-
validation_857.jpg,new seat outside the hospital
validation_858.jpg,thoughts . At one time she had
validation_859.jpg,self as a stranger in these parts
validation_860.jpg,out of operation - in theory , at
validation_861.jpg,gates and thought vagrant
validation_862.jpg,watched the workmen constructing
validation_863.jpg,studying these cross-roads . Which
validation_864.jpg,one to take ?
validation_865.jpg,Diana Wills often sat on the brand
validation_866.jpg,to put St. John's Casualty Department
validation_867.jpg," If I were a tramp I would simply blow a
validation_868.jpg,airy directions accordingly . " If I were needing a
validation_869.jpg,women doctors to blow a feather and follow its
validation_870.jpg,job I 'd go to London , of course , " she went on .
validation_871.jpg,wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded
validation_872.jpg,feather , " she decided , rather envying the gentle-
validation_873.jpg,man of the road his freedom of decision , and
validation_874.jpg,all important . "
validation_875.jpg,I got a good look at her . But if Nigel
validation_876.jpg," Neither can Nigel , " smiled Diana .
validation_877.jpg,I know ? " she smiled . " I think so .
validation_878.jpg," No , " Di said immediately . " It isn't at
validation_879.jpg,wasn't there it isn't important , is it ? "
validation_880.jpg," I remember , " quipped the houseman ,
validation_881.jpg,That blonde was something . " " Anybody
validation_882.jpg,meaning no offence , " but does he ?
validation_883.jpg," He 's saving up to get married . Remember ? "
validation_884.jpg,But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
validation_885.jpg,with a cyst on her ear ... ? "
validation_886.jpg," Nigel , " she had besought him , " you know that evening
validation_887.jpg,you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman
validation_888.jpg,realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it
validation_889.jpg,made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead .
validation_890.jpg,was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
validation_891.jpg,broken down outside and he noticed
validation_892.jpg,you this , too ? " " No , " she laughed .
validation_893.jpg,at the roots and I had a redhead on
validation_894.jpg,it was your car I suppose he
validation_895.jpg," Oh , he wasn't . His motor-bike had
validation_896.jpg," He didn't actually see you . Because
validation_897.jpg,presumed it was you , all dressed up in
validation_898.jpg,your car and then you dancing with
validation_899.jpg,the other arm . He would have told
validation_900.jpg,this blonde . " " Really ? " Nigel cocked
validation_901.jpg,one eyebrow . " Actually she was brunette
validation_902.jpg,evening . " " No , don't , " he said , after
validation_903.jpg,particular surgery ? " " You are a fool ,
validation_904.jpg," Now I wonder which I wore at that
validation_905.jpg," My white or my black ? " Nigel enquired .
validation_906.jpg,the housemen think of me as a
validation_907.jpg,two-timing Don Juan .
validation_908.jpg,exactly what you were doing that
validation_909.jpg,kissing her again . " I rather like to have
validation_910.jpg,darling , " Di said happily . " I shall take
validation_911.jpg,great pleasure in telling that young man
validation_912.jpg," You need your holiday , darling . I only
validation_913.jpg,I 'm such a dull fellow , really . " " Dull ? " She
validation_914.jpg,couldn't believe it . Self-deprecation
validation_915.jpg,I suppose ? " she enquired archly .
validation_916.jpg,wish I could go with you ! " " Doctor
validation_917.jpg," It would make me more interesting ,
validation_918.jpg,was not one of Nigel's usual attributes .
validation_919.jpg,Wills , if you 're making improper suggestions ... ? "
validation_920.jpg," No , it wouldn't ! " he almost snapped ,
validation_921.jpg,leave in the autumn without you
validation_922.jpg,become you to behave like a - a tart , Di . "
validation_923.jpg,body else for a moment there . It doesn't
validation_924.jpg,miserable enough my having to take my
validation_925.jpg," Nigel - ! " she gasped . " I didn't mean to
validation_926.jpg,behave like anything of the kind . I
validation_927.jpg,trying to be bright and gay about it .
validation_928.jpg,surprising her . " You sounded like some-
validation_929.jpg,was only joking . " " Well , don't . It 's
validation_930.jpg,at this time of year ? I can't ask you up because it 's
validation_931.jpg,can't imagine the hospital without me for
validation_932.jpg,a strictly stag affair . " " I know . I didn't expect ... " " Well ,
validation_933.jpg,three weeks , etcetera , etcetera ! "
validation_934.jpg,come with me ; you hope I 'll miss you ; you
validation_935.jpg,don't keep hinting , then . You wish you could
validation_936.jpg,I 'm going with a shooting party . What else can I do
validation_937.jpg,regard first . " I would mind if you didn't " he told her
validation_938.jpg,right , pet . I do need this leave . I 'm bad-tempered and
validation_939.jpg,Her figure was small and exquisite , like a schoolgirl's still , and
validation_940.jpg,broody and going out with brash blondes . I don't deserve
validation_941.jpg,he admired her legs , which the male sex were inclined to
validation_942.jpg,grimly , and tugged her fiercely into his arms . " You 're
validation_943.jpg,you . "
validation_944.jpg,make all the waiting worth while . When we 're
validation_945.jpg," Darling ! " her voiced caressed him . " Moments like this
validation_946.jpg,married we won't have these explosions of emotion ,
validation_947.jpg,isn't as bad as an operation , Nigel ! "
validation_948.jpg,will we ? " " No , " he eyed her strangely . " I wish we
validation_949.jpg,were married , Di . Like a patient wishes his operation
validation_950.jpg,was over . " Again her laughter trilled . " Marriage
validation_951.jpg,me isn't going to be all that bad ?
validation_952.jpg,the moment , thank God ! " Problem ... ?
validation_953.jpg,he could be serious . " Surely marrying
validation_954.jpg," Isn't it ? " he rose and smoothed himself
validation_955.jpg,or a burial ? " she asked , hardly believing
validation_956.jpg,looming ... ? " Are we discussing a marriage
validation_957.jpg,down . " Ask any bridegroom-to-be . Anyhow ,
validation_958.jpg,that particular problem isn't looming at
validation_959.jpg,it , looking moodily beyond her . " Perhaps it 's as
validation_960.jpg,well if you don't wear it for a bit , Di , " he
validation_961.jpg,of amusement in his own eyes , however , he took
validation_962.jpg,your ring back . " She loosened the half-hoop of
validation_963.jpg,diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it

validation_965.jpg,out to him , still playfully . Without a glimmer
validation_966.jpg,If it is - " she laughed uncertainly - " you can have

validation_968.jpg,from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
validation_969.jpg,she was convinced , or he would have granted her small request
validation_970.jpg,Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention ,
validation_971.jpg,room , which proved the elasticity of medical commitments .
validation_972.jpg,Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
