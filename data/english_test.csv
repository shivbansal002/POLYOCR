test_2029.jpg,movements of the Bentley . It had passed
test_2030.jpg,him at the temporary bridge over the
test_2031.jpg,on the presumption that its route had been
test_2032.jpg,through Florence and Rome and then
test_2033.jpg,miles .
test_2034.jpg,Geoffrey set himself to consider the
test_2035.jpg,across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
test_2036.jpg,reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
test_2037.jpg,own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
test_2038.jpg,to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
test_2039.jpg,was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
test_2040.jpg,To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
test_2041.jpg,asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
test_2042.jpg,But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
test_2043.jpg,vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
test_2044.jpg,He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
test_2045.jpg,coming back from Barbados so soon . " Beryl
test_2046.jpg,too . They 're both here . " " I didn't know she was
test_2047.jpg," I caught him just as he was going to the
test_2048.jpg,of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
test_2049.jpg,said the first thing that came into her head .
test_2050.jpg,for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party
test_2051.jpg,airport to meet Blanche , " he said . " As a matter
test_2052.jpg,north of the island .
test_2053.jpg,poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared ,
test_2054.jpg,had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them
test_2055.jpg,nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile
test_2056.jpg,express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
test_2057.jpg,of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl
test_2058.jpg,suggested having a second party , the following week , he
test_2059.jpg,Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
test_2060.jpg,Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to
test_2061.jpg,earned gratuity to his native village at the
test_2062.jpg,with injustice and contempt , ignoring
test_2063.jpg,It was all over and done with .
test_2064.jpg,it go at that , but she resolved to have
test_2065.jpg,ignorant child .
test_2066.jpg,her explanations as though he were
test_2067.jpg,For the time being Beryl was content to let
test_2068.jpg,opportunity presented itself . He must
test_2069.jpg,it out with Piers when a reasonable
test_2070.jpg,learn that he could not treat her
test_2071.jpg,a schoolmaster and she a small ,
test_2072.jpg,her great disappointment at being
test_2073.jpg,them . But next morning she insisted
test_2074.jpg,He gave her no chance of any private
test_2075.jpg,relations , and tell them of
test_2076.jpg,held up in Balicou .
test_2077.jpg,conversation that evening , for when
test_2078.jpg,to find , if possible , Hubert and his
test_2079.jpg,Blanche and Jack left , he went with
test_2080.jpg,on his taking her out in the jeep -
test_2081.jpg,he asked , letting in the clutch . " No ; I want
test_2082.jpg,beside him . " Is that all you want to do ? "
test_2083.jpg,to make you understand just what happened
test_2084.jpg,coldly . " I 'm a little tired of being treated
test_2085.jpg,about this Balicou trip , " she returned
test_2086.jpg,With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his
test_2087.jpg,like an ineffective imbecile . "
test_2088.jpg,Boxer , to the back , and made room for her
test_2089.jpg,to make the presentation , I run the damned
test_2090.jpg,to account for my manners , " he retorted .
test_2091.jpg," And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called
test_2092.jpg,sugary things you ought to have been there
test_2093.jpg,you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
test_2094.jpg,fault . "
test_2095.jpg," What have I done wrong now ? I cover up for
test_2096.jpg,party to the best of my ability - saying the
test_2097.jpg,to say - and all you can do is to find
test_2098.jpg," It 's your superior attitude that riles me . " Beryl was
test_2099.jpg,at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree . You
test_2100.jpg,as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
test_2101.jpg,scarlet with annoyance . " How I happened to be marooned
test_2102.jpg,and his pals down . "
test_2103.jpg,look as though it was only what you expected of me ,
test_2104.jpg," Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !
test_2105.jpg,to understand all the whys and
test_2106.jpg,wherefores of your actions , " he said
test_2107.jpg,stiffly . " Still less to criticise you . "
test_2108.jpg,path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
test_2109.jpg,brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
test_2110.jpg," If you want my true opinion I 'll give it .
test_2111.jpg," As your employee it 's not my business
test_2112.jpg,Be yourself , " she exclaimed , with
test_2113.jpg,mounting exasperation . " Very well ! " He
test_2114.jpg,the matter because , very naturally , you were
test_2115.jpg,sake show a glimmer of reason , " was his
test_2116.jpg,You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .
test_2117.jpg,equally indignant rejoinder .
test_2118.jpg,I 'll give you credit for that . But you didn't press
test_2119.jpg,idyllic surroundings . " " How dare you say
test_2120.jpg,thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
test_2121.jpg,such a thing ? " she blazed . " For goodness'
test_2122.jpg,from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something
test_2123.jpg,amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to
test_2124.jpg," I know . Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want
test_2125.jpg,have had it in for Guy .
test_2126.jpg,if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
test_2127.jpg,gain her attention . " The truth is that
test_2128.jpg,you to think badly of me . " She turned away
test_2129.jpg,time originally arranged , Sir John would
test_2130.jpg,on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
test_2131.jpg,You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake
test_2132.jpg,hardly have spoken with more contempt .
test_2133.jpg,dares to stand up to him . "
test_2134.jpg," What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
test_2135.jpg,flamingoes our first morning on the island . "
test_2136.jpg,through Sir John's nonsense ? " Piers could
test_2137.jpg,A bully like that respects anyone who
test_2138.jpg,trying to say that Hewson would victimise
test_2139.jpg,precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
test_2140.jpg,important customers . " " So what ? You 're not
test_2141.jpg,Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
test_2142.jpg,Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
test_2143.jpg,courage !
test_2144.jpg,island I needn't tell you that Sir John
test_2145.jpg,Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
test_2146.jpg,She said icily , " As you pride yourself on
test_2147.jpg,your knowledge of all the affairs of the
test_2148.jpg," What they can bring off ! I 'll admit that .
test_2149.jpg,between what a senior and a junior
test_2150.jpg,himself and his business to an unmention-
test_2151.jpg,He 's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
test_2152.jpg,partner can do , " was her quick reply .
test_2153.jpg,able destination . " " There 's a difference
test_2154.jpg,But Forrest might at least have tried . He 's
test_2155.jpg,pretty spineless ! "
test_2156.jpg,with Sir John ? " she enquired cuttingly .
test_2157.jpg,I doubt it . He 's about as easy to push around
test_2158.jpg,an attempt to show my lady-love that I
test_2159.jpg,at that , but went on airily , " I 'd have made
test_2160.jpg," For all your good opinion of yourself ,
test_2161.jpg,put her interests before my own .
test_2162.jpg,as - as a grounded whale ! " He had to smile
test_2163.jpg," You think you could have carried more weight
test_2164.jpg,that her failure to appear at a function
test_2165.jpg,man was , she thought impatiently ,
test_2166.jpg,and warm sympathy , as she explained
test_2167.jpg,to have been guests at yesterday's
test_2168.jpg,on the estate was a major error :
test_2169.jpg,how she had come to miss the party ,
test_2170.jpg,made her send a complacent glance
test_2171.jpg,celebrations , and their friendly welcome
test_2172.jpg,Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
test_2173.jpg,in Piers' direction . What a fuss-box the
test_2174.jpg,trying to worry her into the belief
test_2175.jpg,toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her
test_2176.jpg,at the Villa in time .

test_2193.jpg,did not act as though he found it necessary

test_2195.jpg,ways , even to reading law about two hours each
test_2196.jpg,judge always had on the table at dinner , he
test_2197.jpg,He had almost entirely settled back into his old
test_2198.jpg,against them with the lift of the next wave .
test_2199.jpg,of a mile and a half , came the yawl under her full
test_2200.jpg,Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
test_2201.jpg,triangular sail , and to the judge's frightened eyes , so
test_2202.jpg,close to the rocks that it would be dashed
test_2203.jpg,white spray could be seen flying across the distance
test_2204.jpg,with part of that howling northwest gale .
test_2205.jpg,What does time mean when weighed against the life of

test_2216.jpg,Willie Kim was speechless , only his slant
test_2217.jpg," My God ! " the judge cried out . " The boy
test_2218.jpg,is going to try to make a landing on the
test_2219.jpg,quick shift of tiller , and at the same time
test_2220.jpg,jibbing the boom to which he had the
test_2221.jpg,corner of the pier by inches , and
test_2222.jpg,It seemed to the frightened judge
test_2223.jpg,same time dropping the small sheet
test_2224.jpg,of wet canvas , Bill cleared the
test_2225.jpg,with the tiller still hard over , brought
test_2226.jpg,the tiller hard over and at the
test_2227.jpg,as though his son would actually
test_2228.jpg,shoot the craft in under the outer

test_2232.jpg,that were a little unsteady , they

test_2234.jpg,reached the pier , the judge on legs

test_2242.jpg,mine seems to know how to do
test_2243.jpg," Hello , Dad ! " Bill called . " I hope you

test_2259.jpg,You look . Little one more as fifteen
test_2260.jpg,of water , tossed out a string of silvery
test_2261.jpg,With four doing the job and the waves
test_2262.jpg,lake trout and said - 3" Bill , he 's better

test_2265.jpg,down , exposing its shallow keel .
test_2266.jpg," By George , that is a beautiful string of fish ! "
test_2267.jpg,and then we 'll all get hold and heave . " A
test_2268.jpg,with tears . " It 's so unfair , " she said .
test_2269.jpg,Bertram's face was grim . " You think it was the Snort ,
test_2270.jpg,don't you ? " John gave a short laugh . " I did , " he
test_2271.jpg,said ; " but I 'd better stop thinking that now .
test_2272.jpg,Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one . "
test_2273.jpg," So there you are , my dear . " Peggy 's eyes filled
test_2274.jpg,in sharing his discomfort with Peggy .
test_2275.jpg,sick . Just because he 's an Honourable he can do

test_2280.jpg,months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
test_2281.jpg,bombs during the last war . Having deposited his
test_2282.jpg,went in search of a drink . The lower bar was
test_2283.jpg,empty , save for the lady known by all habitue
test_2284.jpg,interest to The George , unhappily destroyed by German
test_2285.jpg,baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
test_2286.jpg,So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head , that
test_2287.jpg,famous Portsmouth hostelry , second only in historic
test_2288.jpg,man who was staring moodily into a gin
test_2289.jpg,*?2s as ' Seaweed ' , and a youngish , sharp-eyed
test_2290.jpg,and tonic .
test_2291.jpg,of the hotel . She greeted John , however , with less
test_2292.jpg,than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
test_2293.jpg,memory was good , so was this stranger's .
test_2294.jpg,of the bar was not 6persona grata . If her
test_2295.jpg,Seaweed's memory was prodigious ; her manner
test_2296.jpg," You 're Commander Winter , " he said . " Have a
test_2297.jpg,must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors

test_2300.jpg,Youngest D.S.C. in the war , what ? Crawled
test_2301.jpg,what ! ' - as the Guards officer said on his return
test_2302.jpg,from a visit to the Royal Navy . Submarines , what .
test_2303.jpg,bomb . Should have been a V.C.
test_2304.jpg,habits . ' Drink gin and call each other wallahs ,
test_2305.jpg," Make it a large one , darling . I know the naval

test_2307.jpg,inherited desire to snub the man . If he did he
test_2308.jpg,came to the rescue . " You haven't introduced
test_2309.jpg,obviously thirsty . " John fought back his
test_2310.jpg,the lounge or return to his bedroom .
test_2311.jpg,Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
test_2312.jpg,would have to leave the bar and either sit in
test_2313.jpg,What are you waiting for , darling ? The officer is
test_2314.jpg,yourself , " she said with mock severity .
test_2315.jpg,was . I 'm Ian Bawley . Does that mean anything
test_2316.jpg,fault entirely , " said the stranger . " It 's my conceited
test_2317.jpg,in the Daily Courier .
test_2318.jpg,to you ? " It did . Ian Bawley's name was
test_2319.jpg,strangers - that 's right , John , isn't it ? " " My
test_2320.jpg,printed at the head of most naval articles
test_2321.jpg," It 's a rule on these premises . No treating with
test_2322.jpg,nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
test_2323.jpg,otherwise than take it . " Pleased to meet you ,
test_2324.jpg,Commander , " he said . " Now what about that
test_2325.jpg,drink ? " John nodded - he could afford to buy
test_2326.jpg,one in return and he was lonely .
test_2327.jpg,He held out his hand and John could not do
test_2328.jpg,Bawley ? " " A pressman is always on the job . "
test_2329.jpg," Oh , the Press , " said Seaweed . " Down here on business , Mr.
test_2330.jpg,absolutely right , " said Bawley , as he pushed over
test_2331.jpg,a Lieutenant-Commander . Perhaps we could
test_2332.jpg,please don't address me as Commander . I 'm
test_2333.jpg,all else . We pride ourselves about accuracy on
test_2334.jpg,his glass . " Fill it up , darling . Accuracy above
test_2335.jpg,drop the rank - such a mouthful ! " " You 're
test_2336.jpg," For the sake of accuracy , " he said , " and I
test_2337.jpg,know how you newspaper people value that commodity ! -
test_2338.jpg,the Courier .
test_2339.jpg,Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service ?

test_2346.jpg,he was on the verge of a new chapter in
test_2347.jpg,Life at home and in Bath had been a
test_2348.jpg,Bawley . " The truth is usually very embarra-
test_2349.jpg,He 'd never before met a pressman and
test_2350.jpg,found him curiously stimulating . " You 're a
test_2351.jpg,trifle too comfortable and humdrum .
test_2352.jpg,said John .
test_2353.jpg," You know a great deal about me , "
test_2354.jpg,bit of a humorist , aren't you ? " said
test_2355.jpg,ssing . You 're in submarines , aren't you ? "
test_2356.jpg," It 's my business . I 'll tell you more . You 're
test_2357.jpg,right ? " " Who told you ? " " Little bird .
test_2358.jpg,going to take over command of Pericles . Am I

test_2360.jpg,'em up , darling ! "
test_2361.jpg,shook his head . " All paid for by His Lordship , "
test_2362.jpg,man with a couple of kids . Can't go wasting
test_2363.jpg,he said . " Expense account . You 're a married
test_2364.jpg,your substance on a complete stranger . Set
test_2365.jpg,why should you ? " " I see . " John took the
test_2366.jpg,companion . " You want me to talk , is that it ? "
test_2367.jpg,John flushed . " I 'm not in need of charity . " " Come
test_2368.jpg,off it , " said Bawley . " The proprietor of the Daily
test_2369.jpg,refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
test_2370.jpg,Courier knows what 's going on . If he doesn't mind ,
test_2371.jpg,in the shiny papers ? "
test_2372.jpg,of course . " " On one condition , " said John .
test_2373.jpg,nothing to tell me , yet . But we 'll be meeting
test_2374.jpg," Tell me who the little bird was . " " Can't
test_2375.jpg,have dinner with me ? On His Lordship ,
test_2376.jpg,again , no doubt , and then you will have .
test_2377.jpg," You misjudge me , " said Bawley . " You have
test_2378.jpg,Regard this as a softening-up process , and
test_2379.jpg,you guess ? Whose portrait appears regularly
test_2380.jpg," Robbie " and friend ' , what ? You know the
test_2381.jpg,Service matters . "
test_2382.jpg,said John , " but you can pay for my drinks

test_2384.jpg,if you want to , as long as you keep off
test_2385.jpg," You mean Munyard ? " " Sure . Very useful
test_2386.jpg,sort of thing . " " You 'll get nothing out of me , "
test_2387.jpg,we give him the publicity . ' The Honourable

test_2391.jpg,Bawley was a man of his word . He kept
test_2392.jpg,passed all too quickly . As they parted in
test_2393.jpg,host and a splendid raconteur . The evening
test_2394.jpg,the vestibule the two men were well
test_2395.jpg,away from Service matters , was an excellent
test_2396.jpg,lets me off the chain I 'll take you
test_2397.jpg,John took it and put it in his pocket .
test_2398.jpg,of the work is done . " He held out a card .
test_2399.jpg,give me a ring at this number and I 'll
test_2400.jpg," You should . Next time you 're in Town
test_2401.jpg,take you round the pubs where most

test_2403.jpg,up on that .
test_2404.jpg," Ever been to Fleet Street ? " asked Bawley .
test_2405.jpg," I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
test_2406.jpg,lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
test_2407.jpg," I don't know when that will be , " said John .
test_2408.jpg,Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
test_2409.jpg,Glad I met you . Don't forget to give me a ring -
test_2410.jpg,Master bloody Munyard . " THERE were six submarines ,
test_2411.jpg,charged their electric batteries .
test_2412.jpg,sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
test_2413.jpg,any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley , what ? "
test_2414.jpg,a substantial breakfast . Although usually a very

test_2472.jpg,man who 'd brought us into this business .
test_2473.jpg,fascinated by the way he looked when you

test_2484.jpg,could see far over west and north for many
test_2485.jpg,a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
test_2486.jpg,malpais .
test_2487.jpg,lifted up in the distance like a pale water-

test_2493.jpg," The mine-workings lie north of the town , "

test_2528.jpg,in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow .
test_2529.jpg,gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
test_2530.jpg,were going on in his bewildered brain . When
test_2531.jpg,life came up before him in some cinematic

test_2541.jpg,dly decadence and absorption in debase-
test_2542.jpg,baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
test_2543.jpg,Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
test_2544.jpg,canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
test_2545.jpg,outbuilding , but this was happening to him now . He
test_2546.jpg,ment and Satanic debauchery .
test_2547.jpg,saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed

test_2549.jpg,speak normally .
test_2550.jpg,hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
test_2551.jpg,in London . Very strange his eyes looked . Mad ,

test_2558.jpg,to take a look at the church . I 've
test_2559.jpg,never been inside . Very remiss of
test_2560.jpg,the thought came to me I 'd like
test_2561.jpg,as the dawn was breaking , and
test_2562.jpg,windows , sir , they date back to
test_2563.jpg," Yes . I travelled down from London
test_2564.jpg,led the way in . " The stained glass
test_2565.jpg,and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone

test_2567.jpg,taxi . " Just a moment , darling , " Gavin pressed her
test_2568.jpg,quickly through the customs . " Gay ! " " Gavin ! " The girl

test_2570.jpg,There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
test_2571.jpg,together . The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
test_2572.jpg,went quickly back to fetch them .
test_2573.jpg,taxi , and then found that in
test_2574.jpg,of despair Gay knew that of course
test_2575.jpg,Gavin she had left her sun-
test_2576.jpg,off the plane with him were talking .
test_2577.jpg,pocket-book , with a sick feeling
test_2578.jpg,the excitement of meeting
test_2579.jpg,Gavin and the girl who had got
test_2580.jpg,glasses on the veranda . She
test_2581.jpg,He was writing something in his
test_2582.jpg,Gay went out to the waiting
test_2583.jpg,beach . A moon like this mustn't be wasted . "
test_2584.jpg,He gestured towards the bay where the full
test_2585.jpg,laid his hand on hers . Gay smiled at him
test_2586.jpg,kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
test_2587.jpg,only , yet remembering for a second the
test_2588.jpg,now Gavin was in love with her and her
test_2589.jpg,again , happy beyond belief , knowing that
test_2590.jpg," And then we 'll go for a stroll along the
test_2591.jpg,moon was just rising over the rocks , then
test_2592.jpg,would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and
test_2593.jpg,look the other way if need be . " I say ! " Gavin was looking over her
test_2594.jpg,lovely , she 's French , a very well known model I believe .
test_2595.jpg,All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her . She
test_2596.jpg,shoulder . " That 's a pretty girl ! " Gay glanced behind her , " Isn't she
test_2597.jpg,Lilyan remonstrated . " They want to be
test_2598.jpg,can't find a table for two . "
test_2599.jpg,cafe*?2 , " Doc said , " they are packed
test_2600.jpg,sitting just inside having coffee .
test_2601.jpg,tonight so come and join us if you

test_2603.jpg,alone . " " I 've booked a table at the
test_2604.jpg,Gay , a little puzzled , went through
test_2605.jpg,to the bar . Doc and Lilyan were
test_2606.jpg," Come and join us and bring your
test_2607.jpg,Gay thanked him and walked out on to
test_2608.jpg,As Gay watched he offered the girl a
test_2609.jpg,She looked round scanning the tables ,
test_2610.jpg,then caught her breath , a cold hand
test_2611.jpg,hers in an intimate way .
test_2612.jpg,seated at a small table in a shadowy
test_2613.jpg,corner talking animatedly to Simone .
test_2614.jpg,had bought a drink and taken it outside .
test_2615.jpg,cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
test_2616.jpg,seeming to clutch her heart . Gavin was
test_2617.jpg,the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
test_2618.jpg,Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
test_2619.jpg,but she turned away , giving a little
test_2620.jpg,gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
test_2621.jpg,run upstairs to her room , knowing that
test_2622.jpg,Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
test_2623.jpg,loved her , was already flirting with a girl
test_2624.jpg,decided to go back and join Lilyan and
test_2625.jpg,Larry's advice flashed through her mind ,
test_2626.jpg,Gavin although he had told her that he
test_2627.jpg,that he had only met a few minutes before .
test_2628.jpg,as Gay drew out a chair and sat
test_2629.jpg,that Larry had given her , while she
test_2630.jpg,anything , " Gay told herself desperately ,
test_2631.jpg,The others were all dancing and
test_2632.jpg,Simone on to the floor . " It doesn't mean
test_2633.jpg,trying to understand Gavin's point of
test_2634.jpg,view and remembering the advice
test_2635.jpg,felt wretched beyond words .
test_2636.jpg,down Gavin , without a word , swept
test_2637.jpg,to help her control her feelings . " Come and
test_2638.jpg,with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
test_2639.jpg,ging a smile .
test_2640.jpg,taste but it was unkind beyond words . She fumbled
test_2641.jpg,lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana-
test_2642.jpg,His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
test_2643.jpg,dance , " Doc's cheery voice came as a
test_2644.jpg,not wanting to smoke but needing some action
test_2645.jpg,and no doubt he would come back soon and
test_2646.jpg,would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
test_2647.jpg,kisses on the way back to the hotel .
test_2648.jpg,after Simone had left expect her to accept his
test_2649.jpg,and Simone go through the doorway that led
test_2650.jpg,down to the beach . Gay closed her eyes for a
test_2651.jpg,As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
test_2652.jpg,moment in disgust . She was fully aware that Gavin
test_2653.jpg,mentally adolescent cad . " " Oh , Doc ... " Gay protested
test_2654.jpg,Sentence Database P02-109
test_2655.jpg,weakly , " you don't know Gavin . " " I 've only met him
test_2656.jpg,today but I think I can safely say that I know
test_2657.jpg,heart out over ? " Doc nodded towards the door . " You

test_2659.jpg," And that 's the man whom you have been eating your
test_2660.jpg,him a great deal better than you do . "

test_2662.jpg,who doesn't care two jots for your feelings .
test_2663.jpg,thought you were sensible too . Don't
test_2664.jpg,If he behaves like this now what is your
test_2665.jpg,fine girl , intelligent , and pretty , and I had
test_2666.jpg,make a fool of yourself over someone
test_2667.jpg,yourself away on a chap like that . You 're a
test_2668.jpg,Gay , and don't even contemplate throwing
test_2669.jpg,Doc gave her hand a shake . " Wake up
test_2670.jpg,married life going to be like ?
test_2671.jpg,glad to be able to occupy herself .
test_2672.jpg,dining together . She opened her bag
test_2673.jpg,letter . She drew it out and opened it ,
test_2674.jpg,was behaving since they had seen them
test_2675.jpg,Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
test_2676.jpg,to get out her compact and saw Grace's
test_2677.jpg,feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that
test_2678.jpg,people were talking about the way Gavin
test_2679.jpg,again Gay found herself alone at the table
test_2680.jpg,He 's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
test_2681.jpg," So glad that you are having such a lovely time , dearie , "
test_2682.jpg,and have been over to sit with her father and do what
test_2683.jpg,it ran . " Your cards are lovely . I rang up Miss Harland

test_2688.jpg,knew why Gavin had come to see
test_2689.jpg,Gay read the rest of the letter then put
test_2690.jpg,Everything was quite clear now , and to
test_2691.jpg,to the man she had spent so much time

test_2696.jpg,rather a sense of relief now that she
test_2697.jpg,her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak ,
test_2698.jpg,for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she

test_2700.jpg," That is a pretty dress , " Lilyan commented , obviously sensing
test_2701.jpg,Because she was second best . The others came back

test_2706.jpg,was hurt for herself .
test_2707.jpg,one has to know something about fishing

test_2714.jpg,ful jobs in London and I could
test_2715.jpg,and in Liverpool they 'd want sea-farers .
test_2716.jpg,all about that . "
test_2717.jpg,Sometimes they talked on the theme of " when we get married " ,
test_2718.jpg,and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been
test_2719.jpg,that lark , I can tell you ! "
test_2720.jpg,a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last
test_2721.jpg,She was engaged to Nigel , had been for two years .

test_2724.jpg,Little Phelpham .
test_2725.jpg,She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
test_2726.jpg,with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
test_2727.jpg,which ' lark ' she would have to stop , only that significant tiny
test_2728.jpg,which now took on an ominous significance : Nigel had been
test_2729.jpg,word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
test_2730.jpg,seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
test_2731.jpg,the situation would have been intolerable
test_2732.jpg,when she was not free ; this much they had
test_2733.jpg,about their relationship . So when Nigel
test_2734.jpg,Now Nigel had every right to go where he
test_2735.jpg,had there not been some give and take
test_2736.jpg,liked during his off-duty periods
test_2737.jpg,had told her about taking Luke's
test_2738.jpg,conceded one to the other . They rarely
test_2739.jpg,found they were off duty together , and
test_2740.jpg,evening surgery she had said ,
test_2741.jpg,of variety and it 's a change . " Nigel was the hospital's
test_2742.jpg,he shrugged diffidently , " I like the work . One gets plenty
test_2743.jpg,asked hopefully .
test_2744.jpg,suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ? " she had
test_2745.jpg,Junior Medical Officer . " You won't be free about nine , I
test_2746.jpg," Bless you ! I hope Luke is suitably grateful , darling . " " Oh , well , "
test_2747.jpg,I 've got to see 'em . If I am free , though ,
test_2748.jpg," Hardly likely , my sweet . Luke's surgery goes on for
test_2749.jpg,I 'll give you a ring , O.K. ? " O.K. , " she had
test_2750.jpg,replied readily . So how could Nigel have
test_2751.jpg,dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
test_2752.jpg,hours . If they get in before eight-thirty , even
test_2753.jpg,though they 're standing on one another's toes ,

test_2757.jpg,NUF 121 . " " He probably loaned his car
test_2758.jpg," No , " she told Phil Gubbins , a junior
test_2759.jpg,Nigel from the back . D.j. and all .
test_2760.jpg,Young Gubbins shrugged . " I didn't see his
test_2761.jpg,to somebody , Phil . He 's always doing that . "
test_2762.jpg,to go into the Load of Trouble . "
test_2763.jpg,Of course such as I couldn't afford

test_2765.jpg,my lad . " " It was Nigel's car , anyway .
test_2766.jpg,With a blonde , too . Imagine ! " Nigel was frowning . He

test_2768.jpg,suddenly in an upsurging of relief , " that stupid
test_2769.jpg,Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble .
test_2770.jpg," 5Ye-es ? " he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
test_2771.jpg,handsome at other times .
test_2772.jpg," What about it , my sweet ? " " Well , " she laughed
test_2773.jpg,looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly
test_2774.jpg," Gubbins ? Gubbins ? " he fretted . " Who 's he ? "
test_2775.jpg,he now demanded . " What was he
test_2776.jpg,member of the staff , distinguished or not ,
test_2777.jpg,Nigel often had to think hard to sort
test_2778.jpg,doing at the Load of Trouble ? "
test_2779.jpg,them out . " He 's the carrotty lad , isn't he ? "
test_2780.jpg,Though Diana knew the name of every
test_2781.jpg," Don't be such a baby ! " They were going
test_2782.jpg,to have an open quarrel
test_2783.jpg,joking , Nigel . " " You shouldn't joke
test_2784.jpg," But I want it ! " she protested . " It 's my ring . "
test_2785.jpg," You just gave it back to me . " " I
test_2786.jpg,didn't ! I was joking . You know I was
test_2787.jpg,any minute , and she knew it .
test_2788.jpg,about serious things like engagements . "
test_2789.jpg,Almost in desperation she appealed , " Will you meet
test_2790.jpg,he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
test_2791.jpg,kissing somebody else's girl , " he decided wickedly ,
test_2792.jpg,receive a sharp slap for his pains .
test_2793.jpg,me up for tea , of course . I just thought . " " I 'll see , "
test_2794.jpg,me at the gate , four o'clock tomorrow ? " " Why ? " he
test_2795.jpg,enquired , combing his thick , tawny hair . " To bring
test_2796.jpg,which really hurt . " Without your ring it 's just like
test_2797.jpg,and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
test_2798.jpg,what you 'd get , " she flashed at him , and
test_2799.jpg,out of his sight . " Mine , " Nigel Lester had
test_2800.jpg,decided with a sigh of satisfaction , and
